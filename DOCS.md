# Maze Runner üèÉ

A test runner for validating requests.

## How it works

The test harness launches a mock API which awaits requests from sample applications. Using the runner, each scenario is 
executed and the requests are validated to have to correct fields and values. Uses Gherkin and Cucumber under the hood 
to draft semantic tests.

[Getting Started](./docs/Getting_Started.md)

## Modes of operation

Internally, Maze Runner has the following modes of operation

* [Appium/Devices](./docs/Device_Mode.md) - For running tests with Appium on local Android/iOS device or using a device 
  farm such as Bitbar or BrowserStack.
* [Selenium/Browsers](./docs/Browser_Mode.md) - For running tests with Selenium locally using a browser farm such as 
  Bitbar or BrowserStack.
* Standalone - For any purposes that don't use devices or browsers.

## Troubleshooting

### Logging

Maze-runner contains a Ruby logger connected to `STDOUT` that will attempt to log several events that occur during the 
testing life-cycle.  By default, the logger is set to report `INFO` level events or higher, but will log `DEBUG` level 
events if the `VERBOSE` or `DEBUG` flags are set.  If the `QUIET` flag is set it will instead log at the `ERROR` level 
and above.

| Log Level | Event | Information |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `DEBUG` | An error occurs when attempting to open a URL | The error information |
| `DEBUG` | When a command is run | The command string, any `STDOUT` and `STDERR` output, and the exit code |
| `DEBUG` | A request is received | The request method, uri, headers and body |
| `WARN` | The server has not received the desired number of requests | The array of received requests |
| `WARN` | Sleep steps are used | A warning to avoid using sleep where possible |
| `WARN` | A Selenium `StaleElementReferenceError` occurs | The error information |
| `WARN` | A run command fails | The output from the command |
| `FATAL` | The webserver is not running at the start of a test | Error notification before exiting |

### Known issues

* Payload field matching for raw string values can be ambiguous when there is a possible regex match (e.g. when using 
"." as a part of an expected value without escaping it).

### Running the tests

maze-runner uses test-unit and minunit to bootstrap itself and run the sample app suites in the test fixtures. 
Run `bundle exec rake` to run the suite.
