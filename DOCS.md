# Maze Runner üèÉ

A test runner for validating requests.

## How it works

The test harness launches a mock API which awaits requests from sample applications. Using the runner, each scenario is executed and the requests are validated to have to correct fields and values. Uses Gherkin and Cucumber under the hood to draft semantic tests.

[Getting Started](./docs/Getting_Started.md)

## Mock server

In all modes of operation, Maze Runner automatically starts an HTTP server that mocks Bugsnag's server endpoints. This mock server provides a URL for each endpoint that Bugsnag does, allowing it to receive errors, session, builds, source map uploads and traces.

See [Mock Server](./docs/Mock_Server.md) for more details of the options available for controlling the behaviour of the mock 
server.

## Modes of operation
