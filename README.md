# Maze Runner üèÉ

A test runner for validating requests

## How it works

The test harness launches a mock API which awaits requests from sample
applications. Using the runner, each scenario is executed and the requests are
validates to have to correct fields and values. Uses Gherkin and Cucumber under
the hood to draft semantic tests.

## Setting up a new project

1. Install the `bundler` gem:

   ```
   gem install bundler
   ```
2. Add a Gemfile to the root of your project:

   ```ruby
   source "https://rubygems.org"

   gem "bugsnag-maze-runner", git: "git@github.com:bugsnag/maze-runner"
   ```
3. Run `bundle install` to fetch and install Maze Runner
4. Run `bugsnag-maze-runner init` from the root of your project to build the
   basic structure to run test scenarios.
   * `features/fixtures`: Test fixture files, such as sample JSON payloads
   * `features/scripts`: Scripts to be run in scenarios. Any environment
     variables set in scenarios are passed to scripts. The `MOCK_API_PORT`
     variable is provided by default to configure the location of the mock
     server.
   * `features/steps`: Additional steps of the form Given/When/Then required to
     complete scenarios
   * `features/support`: Helper functions. Add any setup which should be run
     once before all of the scenarios to `features/support/env.rb`. Any setup
     which should be run before or after each scenario can go into special
     `Before` and `After` functions respectively.
   * `features/*.feature`: The plain text scenario specifications

   A sample feature is included after running `init`. Try it out with

   ```
   bundle exec bugsnag-maze-runner
   ```

## Writing features

Features should be composed as concisely has possible, reusing existing steps as
needed. The harness provides a number of reusable step definitions for
interacting with scripts, setting environment variables, and inspecting output.
Each new feature should go into a `.feature` file in the `features` directory.

```gherkin
Feature: Sinatra support

Scenario: Sinatra unhandled exception
    When I set environment variable "BUGSNAG_API_KEY" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
    And I start a Sinatra app
    And I navigate to the route "/syntax-error"
    Then I should receive a request
    And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
    And the "Bugsnag-API-Key" header equals "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
    And the event "unhandled" is true
```

This example includes a mix of the included steps as well as custom ones
specific to the library being tested. `When I set an environment variable` is
provided by default while `When I start a Sinatra app` is defined in a custom
steps file in `features/steps/`, wrapping other included steps:

```ruby
When("I start a Sinatra app") do
  set_script_env "DEMO_APP_PORT", "#{DEMO_APP_PORT}"
  steps %Q{
    When I run the script "features/fixtures/run_sinatra_app.sh"
    And I wait for 8 seconds
  }
end

When("I navigate to the route {string}") do |route|
  steps %Q{
    When I open the URL "http://localhost:#{DEMO_APP_PORT}#{route}"
    And I wait for 1 second
  }
end
```

In addition, any helper functions or instance variables defined in
`features/support/env.rb` are available to step files. See the included
`_step.rb` files for examples. The files in `features/support` are evaluated
before scenarios are run, so this is where one-time or per-scenario
configuration should go.

 ```ruby
 # A helper function included with the harness to run commands and
 # only print output when the command fails
 run_required_commands([
   ["bundle", "install"]
 ])

 # Maybe shell out to something directly, if necessary
 `echo Peanut Butter Jelly Time`

 # Run before every scenarios
 Before do
   clean_build_artifacts
 end

# Run after every scenario
After do |scenario|
  # Teardown scenario configuration here

  if scenario.failed?
    # Can be used to do specific cleanup if a scenario fails
  end
end
 ```
 
### Step reference

Whirlwind tour of the most important bundled steps. Additional variants exist for checking value nullability, "starts with", "ends with", et cetera.

Anywhere a `{field}` is denoted, it can be replaced with dot-delimited key path to indicate the path from the root of an object to the intended target.

For example, to match the name of the second objects in the the key `fruits` below, use `fruits.1.name` as the keypath.

```
{
  "fruits": [
  	{ "name": "apple" },
  	{ "name": "cherry" }
  ]
}
```


#### When ...

|Step | Description |
|-----|-------------|
|I set the environment variable "{key}" to "{value}" | Make an environment variable available to any scripts which run afterwards
|I run the script "{path}" | Run the file denoted by `{path}`. It must be marked as executable
|I run the script "{path}" synchronously | Run the file denoted by `{path}`, waiting for it to finish. It must be marked as executable
|I open the URL "{url}"|Fetch the contents of a URL
|I open the URL "{url}" in a browser|Open a URL in the system's default browser
|I open the URL "{url}" in "{browser}"|Open a URL in a specified browser (Only fully implemented for macOS)

#### Then ...

|Step | Description |
|-----|-------------|
|I should receive {n} requests|Assert that the mock server received _n_ requests
|I should receive a request|Assert that the mock server received one request
|the "{name}" header is not null|Assert that the {name} header is set
|the "{name}" header equals "{value}"|Assert that the value of the {name} header is `{value}`
|the "{name}" header is a timestamp|Assert that the value of the {name} header is an ISO8601 timestamp
|the payload body matches the JSON fixes in "{path}"|Assert that the body of a request matches a template in a .json file
|the payload field "{field}" matches the JSON fixture in "{path}"|Assert that a subset of a request body matches a template in a .json file
|the request is a valid for the error reporting API|The correct headers are set, there is at least one event present, every event has a severity, etc
|the event "{field}" equals "{value}"|Assert that a field in the first event in the first request equals a string
|the exception "{field}" equals "{value}"|Assert that a field in the first exception in the first event in the first request equals a string
|the "{field}" of stack frame {n} equals "{value}"|You get the idea

### On matching JSON templates

For the following steps:

```
Then the payload body matches the JSON fixture in "features/fixtures/template.json"
Then the payload field "items.0.subset" matches the JSON fixture in "features/fixtures/template.json"
```

The template file can either be an exact match or specify regex matches for string fields. For example, given the template

```json
{ "fruit": { "apple": { "color": "\\w+" } } }
```

The following request will match:

```json
{ "fruit": { "apple": { "color": "red" } } }
```

Though this request will not match:

```json
{ "fruit": { "apple": { "color": "red-orange" } } }
```

If "IGNORE" is specified as a value in a template, that value will be ignored in requests.

Given the following template:

```json
{ "fruit": { "apple": "IGNORE" } }
```

This request will match:

```json
{ "fruit": { "apple": "some nonsense" } }
```




## Running features

Run the entire suite using `bundle exec bugsnag-maze-runner`. Alternately, you
can specify specific files to run:

```
bundle exec bugsnag-maze-runner features/something.feature
```

Add the `--verbose` option to print script output and a trace of what Ruby file
is being run.

## Contributing

If steps would be useful for different projects running the maze, add the to
`lib/features/steps/`. If there are useful helper functions, add them to
`lib/features/support/*.rb`.

### Running the tests

bugsnag-maze-runner uses test-unit and minunit to bootstrap itself and run the
sample app suites in the test fixtures. Run `rake test` to run the suite.
